# Ghostarchive Lookup

This browser extension adds a "Ghostarchive Lookup" button to your browser toolbar.
When you click it, it searches for the current tab's URL on Ghostarchive.
For both archival and search functionality, four context menus are also added: two
to archive/search the page on Ghostarchive, and two to archive/search a hyperlink
on Ghostarchive. These can be disabled in the Options menu.
